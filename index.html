  <p>We started this page for like minded individuals to get their rocks off to Mr. Devito,
     for all the fine folks who touch themselves regularly as he graces the screen, bigger or small,
      we now have a place to gather and drool. Feel free to submit content via email, or visit our
      <a href="http://dannydevitoblog.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> for quality imagery and fan content!
      If you share the same passions we do, you can also join our mailer liste to receive and review brand new Danny Fan Fics
      as soon as they are posted, as well as prompts to right your own, and a sneak peak of our high-quality staff work!
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YClKSTZ.jpg" /> Our dream is to one day have Mr. Devito do guest reveiws, and pick his personal
      favorites, alas, his lawyers assure us we may be imprisoned for defamation. I think if Danny saw this sight, things would change
      forever! Pray for Danny, Pray for me, and find our contact info to donate to my preemptive bail fund.
